# Data-Wrangling-tweet-archive
Introduction Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. The dataset that I wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. And the numerators almost always greater than 10. 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent."
